## Description:
Travlr is a comprehensive hotel booking web application designed to facilitate the 
seamless searching, filtering, booking, and management of hotel stays. It caters to 
both users looking to book accommodations and website administrators handling
hotel listings.

Overview:
Travlr was conceived as a capstone project to demonstrate a full spectrum of web
development skills from front-end design to back-end functionality. The app
provides a robust platform where users can create an account, search for hotels
using various filters, and book rooms. Key features include authentication, 
hotel management, and secure payment transactions via Stripe.

The development process involved using React.js for the dynamic and responsive
user interface, combined with Express.js and Node.js on the backend to handle 
API requests, user authentication, and interactions with the MongoDB database.
For user and admin convenience, the app includes features like managing bookings
and adding hotel details and images, which are stored using Cloudinary.

This project highlights not only the ability to integrate various technologies 
but also focuses on providing a secure and user-friendly experience. 
The inclusion of payment processing with Stripe and secure authentication
with JWT ensures that Travlr meets real-world business requirements 
for e-commerce platforms
